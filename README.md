# Classification-Task-on-Random-Number-Generators
The Classification Task on Random Number Generators uses machine learning models to differentiate bitstreams from two generators, achieving around 51-52% accuracy. This demonstrates the challenge of detecting patterns in high-dimensional random data, with scope for improvement through advanced techniques.
